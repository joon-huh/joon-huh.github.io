Hello! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (UW–Madison), simultaneously pursuing an M.A. in [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/) at UW–Madison. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Kirthevasan Kandasamy](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kandasamy/).

Prior to this, I pursued a Ph.D. in Physics at UW–Madison until 2021 when I transferred to the Department of Computer Science. I completed my M.S. in Physics from Northwestern University under the mentorship of [Hyejin Youn](http://hyoun.me/) and B.S. in Physics at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea.
