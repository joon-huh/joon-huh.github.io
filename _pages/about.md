Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, simultaneously pursuing an M.A. in [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/). I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Kirthevasan Kandasamy](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kandasamy/).

Prior to this, I pursued a Ph.D. in Physics at UW–Madison until 2021 when I transferred to the Department of Computer Science. I completed my M.S. in Physics from Northwestern University under the mentorship of [Hyejin Youn](http://hyoun.me/) and B.S. in Physics at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea. For details, please refer to my [CV](https://joon-huh.github.io/files/cv_joon.pdf.

My current research interests are broadly in the intersection of online machine learning, game theory and mechanism design. For more details, see my [publications](https://joon-huh.github.io/publications/).
